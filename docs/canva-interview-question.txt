# Survey Data Explanation:
# ----------------------
# This file contains survey data collected from search experts regarding gender reranking.
# Each entry (a survey case) consists of:
#   - "question": A string representing the input sequence (e.g. a sequence of photos) provided to the experts.
#   - "responses": A list of strings, each representing a reranked sequence (as provided by a respondent) that balances relevance and diversity.
# For example, the first case has an input sequence "M M M M M F F F F F" and a list of responses (each a reranked sequence) from the experts.

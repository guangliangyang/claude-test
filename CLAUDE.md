# Claude Code Project Context

## 🎯 Project Overview
This is a machine learning and image processing project for Canva interview preparation, featuring:
- Modular image processing architecture with clean separation of concerns
- ML algorithms implementation (Linear Regression, K-Means, Naive Bayes)
- Comprehensive test suite with 95%+ coverage
- Professional project structure and documentation

## 🏗️ Architecture Status
**Recently Completed Major Refactoring:**
- ✅ Transformed from monolithic to modular architecture
- ✅ Implemented Strategy, Template Method, Factory, Builder patterns
- ✅ Added dependency injection and interface-based design
- ✅ Reorganized project structure into clean directories
- ✅ Fixed code quality issues and test failures

## 📁 Key Directories
- `src/core/` - New modular processing components
- `src/image_processing_v2.py` - New API with backward compatibility
- `scripts/` - Executable scripts (moved from root)
- `benchmarks/` - Performance testing
- `docs/` - All documentation centralized
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite

## 🔧 Current Development Environment
- **IDE**: Cursor with F5 debugging configured
- **Environment**: Conda environment `ml-env` 
- **Python**: 3.9 with scipy, numpy, pytest, etc.
- **Branch**: `canva-interview-test`
- **Status**: All tests passing, clean project structure

## ⚡ Quick Commands
```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Debug in Cursor
python scripts/debug_canva_interview.py

# Performance benchmark
python benchmarks/benchmark_image_processing.py

# Project structure
cat PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
```

## 🎨 Code Quality Improvements Applied
1. **Modularity**: Single-purpose components
2. **Low Coupling**: Dependency injection pattern
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped
4. **Design Patterns**: 5 enterprise patterns applied
5. **Architecture Clarity**: 4-layer clean architecture

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Ready for interview demonstration
- All documentation and examples in place
- Performance benchmarks completed
- Clean, professional codebase structure
